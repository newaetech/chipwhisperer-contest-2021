# NewAE ChipWhisperer Contest 2021!

We're giving away some ChipWhisperer gear. How to participate is simple:

1. Make a [new issue](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-contest-2021/issues), in that issue describe how you'd use a CW305 (FPGA Board) and a capture board (ChipWhisperer-Husky).
2. If you like any other entries give them a heart. You can see an [example issue](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-contest-2021/issues/1) to give you a feel for the minimum requirements.

See https://www.newae.com/hackingcontest for entry details!

## Targets

You'll have a CW305 with Artix A35 to work with (see https://rtfm.newae.com/Targets/CW305%20Artix%20FPGA/) along with a Capture board (the new [ChipWhisperer-Husky](https://www.crowdsupply.com/newae/chipwhisperer-husky)).

The CW305 board has a [AES Getting Started Whitepaper](http://media.newae.com/appnotes/NAE0010_Whitepaper_CW305_AES_SCA_Attack.pdf) about using the AES example, see that whitepaper for more details about the board. The version in the contest has the Artix A35 FPGA (there is two sizes). You can also see our [ECC Paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1520.pdf) which has associated source-code available.

If you haven't done much with power analysis before we're including a copy of a book & our ChipWhisperer.io training as well. Hopefully it means even if you haven't done this hands-on before you can still give it a shot!

Depending on stock we're trying to provide some additional targets to the winner - we can't gaurantee anything yet, but you may have a CW308 board with target to work with, or something else similar to it.
